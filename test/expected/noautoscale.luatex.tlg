l.10 }
    
The control sequence at the end of the top line
of your error message was never \def'ed. If you have
misspelled it (e.g., `\hobx'), type `I' and the correct
spelling (e.g., `I\hbox'). Otherwise just continue,
and I'll forget about whatever was undefined.

! Missing number, treated as zero.
<to be read again> 
\relax 
l.10 }
    
A number should have been here; I inserted `0'.
(If you can't figure out why I needed to see a number,
look up `weird error' in the index to The TeXbook.)


! Package pdfpages Error: Page 1 of `\AM@currentdocname ' does not exist.

See the pdfpages package documentation for explanation.
Type  H <return>  for immediate help.

You have set a wrong page number in the `pages' option. Document 
`\AM@currentdocname ' does not have 1 pages.
