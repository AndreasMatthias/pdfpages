* Evolve

This project provides a large testsuite and uses ~evolve~ to interact with all
tests.  If you know ~l3build~ you will notice that ~evolve~ is quite similar
concerning unit testing.

Get the help message of ~evolve~ with:
#+begin_src 
# evolve help
#+end_src

Each test has a specific setup, that specifies things like the testing
directory, one or more TeX-engines and postprocessing tools to be used for
testing, etc. These configuration settings are stored in a JSON file called
~evolve.json~.

Test files have an extension ~.lvt~ that stands for LaTeX verification test.

* Preliminary
Before starting with unit testing we need to prepare all ~pdf~ files that are
necessary for the tests.
#+begin_src 
cd ./test/
make
#+end_src

* Unit testing

Running a test file ~my-test.lvt~:
#+begin_src
# evolve check my-test
#+end_src

This will run the test file ~my-test.lvt~ in all setting environments specified
for this test in ~evolve.json~. For exampe if the settings are ~lualatex~, ~pdflatex~,
and ~xelatex~, then this test file is checked with all these TeX-engines.

However, if you want to restrict testing of this file to one specific setting,
say ~lualatex~, you can do so with:
#+begin_src 
# evolve check my-test --setting lualatex
#+end_src

The ~log~ files of these test runs are compared against ~tlg~ files that were
created in advance.  A ~tlg~ file represents the ~log~ file of a successful test.

* Creating ~tlg~ files

Creating a ~tlg~ file for test file ~my-test.lvt~:
#+begin_src 
# evolve save my-test
#+end_src

This creates ~tlg~ files for each setting specified in ~evolve.json~ as described
before for ~evolve check~.

Creating a ~tlg~ for one specific setting only, e.g. ~lualatex~:
#+begin_src 
# evolve save my-test --setting lualatex
#+end_src

* Diffing tests

If ~evolve check~ reports that a test failed, you can diff the log files with:
#+begin_src 
# evolve diff my-test --setting lualatex
#+end_src
This will most probably yield large diffs since most test files are running with
LaTeX command ~\showoutput~.

You can get a more pleasant diff with option ~--pdf~ that compares the PDF files
visually:
#+begin_src 
# evolve diff my-test --pdf
#+end_src
