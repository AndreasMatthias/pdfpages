* Combination of Landscape/Portrait


There are some important points that have a significant impact on the layout of
a booklet:

 * Option ~landscape~ of the document class.
 * Option ~landscape~ of the ~\includepdf~ command.
 * Paper format of the included PDF.
 * Option ~nup~ of the ~\includepdf~ command.

Apply option ~landscape~ either for the document class or for the ~\includepdf~ command.
But do not apply it twice, because this will create a paper in ~portrait~ orientation.

 * Option ~swap-flip-edge~

 
The following table shows possible combinations.
