
The pdfpages Package
--------------------

This package simplifies the insertion of external multi-page PDF
documents into LaTeX documents. Pages can be freely selected and
similar to psnup it is possible to put several logical pages onto
each sheet of paper. Furthermore a lot of hypertext features like
hyperlinks and article threads are provided. This package supports
pdfTeX, VTeX, and XeTeX. With VTeX it is even possible to use
this package to insert PostScript files, in addition to PDF files.


INSTALLATION:

To install this package, unzip pdfpages-tds.zip into your TeX-tree,
e.g.:

   unzip -d /usr/local/TL2007/texmf-local/ pdfpages-tds.zip


To create and install the files manually, proceed as follows:

 * Run `latex pdfpages.ins' to produce the LaTeX files
 * Run `latex pdfpages.dtx' to produce the documentation
 * Move the files into appropriate directories searched by LaTeX.
