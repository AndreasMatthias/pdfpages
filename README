
The pdfpages Package
--------------------

The pdfpages package makes it easy to insert pages of external
PDF documents without worrying about the print space. Here are
some features of the pdfpages package: Several logical pages can
be arranged onto each sheet of paper and the layout can be changed
individually. A lot of hypertext operations are supported, like
links to the inserted pages, links to the original PDF document,
threads, etc. When working with VTeX the same is possible with
PostScript documents, too. Note that PostScript documents are only
supported by VTeX and /not/ by pdfLaTeX.

Run `latex pdfpages.ins' to produce pdfpages.sty and the
driver files pppdftex.def, ppvtex.def and ppnull.def.
Move these files into a directory searched by LaTeX.

Run `latex pdfpages.dtx' to produce the documentation.

Run `pdflatex pdf-ex.tex', `pdflatex pdf-hyp.tex',
and `pdflatex pdf-toc.tex' to produce some examples.
