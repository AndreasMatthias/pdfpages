
The pdfpages Package
--------------------

This package makes it easy to include pages of external PDF
documents. It is possible to arrange two or four logical
pages on each physical sheet of paper. (Like `psnup'.)

The package is based on pdfLaTeX and does not work with
LaTeX.

Run `latex pdfpages.ins' to produce pdfpages.sty.

Run `latex pdfpages.dtx' to produce the documentation.

Run `pdflatex pdf-ex.tex' to produce a demonstration of the package.
